# E-Commerce-shipping-cost-Analysis

This project dives into the world of e-commerce logistics, specifically focusing on shipping cost analysis and delivery performance optimization for a fictional company operating across Australia. Using a large synthetic dataset generated with the Faker Python library, I explored real-world challenges such as cost efficiency, delivery times, and customer satisfaction through data-driven analysis.

The dataset includes detailed information on customers, products, orders, employees, and shipping companies, all with built-in discrepancies to simulate the complexity of real-world data. This allowed me to practice comprehensive data cleaning techniques before running SQL queries to answer 18 critical business questions. These questions span across areas like customer spending behavior, regional shipping costs, transportation modes, and product profitability.

The final analysis offers actionable recommendations on how businesses can optimize their shipping processes, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency.
